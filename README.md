# <center>CNN Visualization</center>

This notebook explains how to visualize convolutional neural network weights along with how to visualize activations associated with these weights. In other words, how to visualize filters and the result of convolving these filters with their inputs.

The main library for this notebook is Keras with tensorflow backend. Some useful functions to get access to weights and activation described.
